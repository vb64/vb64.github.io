# PotTeleBot FAQ

## Can I add a bot to an existing Telegram group, and not create a new group for the joint expenses?

You can. But each member of this existing group will have to explicitly join the participation in the joint expenses.

The bot will automatically add to the joint expenses the administrators of the group. If the group has option “all members are admins”, then only the creator of the group will be added. In order for a group member to join the joint expenses, he needs to send `/start` command to the group chat.
