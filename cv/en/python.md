## Contributing to open-source projects

At various times I was involved in the development of several open-source software projects, including DjangoProject.

My code for using relative paths in Django's extend and include tags, originally developed as a [plugin for Django versions 1.4 - 1.9](https://github.com/vb64/django.templates.relative.path), has been approved by the Django core team and is [included in the 1.10 release](https://github.com/django/django/commit/aec4f97555cbfc9d14d698f61d43a478f5911661).

You can also consider the libraries I developed:

- [DjangoAdminGeomap](https://github.com/vb64/django.admin.geomap) to display objects on the map in the Django views and admin site.
- [DjangoAdminFilters](https://github.com/vb64/django.admin.filters) providing additional filters in Django admin site tables.


## Own projects

I have several of my own independently developed projects, available publicly. The projects are developed in Python for the Google App Engine Standard Environment platform.

Most popular project is an [EmailGateBot](https://vb64.github.io/telegram.email.notify/docs/en/guide.html) - bot in Telegram Messenger. Assigns a special email address to Telegram channels and groups and publishes emails in them.
