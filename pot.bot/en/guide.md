# Cost sharing with PotTeleBot of Telegram Messenger

![The picture to attract attention](costs.jpeg)

@PotTeleBot in Telegram Messenger will help you comfortably manage the joint expenses of a group of people. Tell the bot about the funds spent on the general needs of the group, and the bot will tell each group member how much money he should receive or pay after this operation.

The person in charge of the cash desk should create a group in Telegram Messenger, add PotTeleBot as group member and send out invitations to all members of the group for joint expenses.

When a group member buys something for common needs, he writes to the bot how much he spent and what he bought in a private chat. This report comes to the Telegram of admin of the group (responsible for cash). If he approves this report, the bot writes a balance to the chat of the group after this new purchase: who should contribute how much to the general cash desk or, on the contrary, get from. The balance of the group can always be requested from the bot by command /shared in the chat of the group. The /total command will show how much each member spent and the total expenses in the group.

In addition to reports on purchases, the bot accepts requests for mutual settlements between group members.

For example, Johnny must refill $100 to the cashier, and Peter must receive $50 from the cashier. Johnny can give $50 to Peter and write an application to the bot about it. A bot asks Peter if he got $50 from Johnny? If Peter confirms this fact, the bot will change the balance of Johnny and Peter, and report the new balance to the group chat: Johnny must refill $50 to the cashier, Peter has a zero balance.

You can participate in several groups of cost sharing. For example, in a group of joint expenses at work and in a group of expenses for hiking with friends. In this case, when entering data, the bot will ask you which group this operation belongs to.
